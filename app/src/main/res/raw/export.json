Heinlein Blood Drive returns for its 43rd massive year in 2019 with a 5-day drive. <br \/> <br \/> Our blood drive is San Diego Blood Bank’s largest and longest-running event: last year we collected 2,804 pints of blood over our 4-day convention, our biggest year ever. <br \/> <br \/> The growth of our blood drive over the years has been phenomenal. The Robert A. Heinlein Blood Drive began at San Diego Comic-Con back in 1977. That first year, 148 pints of blood were collected, and as the convention has grown, so has our blood drive. Over the past 42 years 22,607 pints of blood have been donated by Comic-Con attendees! San Diego Blood Bank estimates that our 42-year total has saved more than 67 thousand lives!! <br \/> <br \/> This year blood donors will receive a free Avengers: End Game tee shirt and other goodies. <br \/> PLUS, donors are also entered into daily drawings for many fantastic prizes donated by Exhibitors, Professionals, and Staff. <br \/> <br \/> Where: Grand Hyatt Hotel, 4th floor, in the Coronado Ballroom<br \/> <br \/> When:<br \/> Wednesday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM<br \/> Thursday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM<br \/> Friday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM<br \/> Saturday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM<br \/> Sunday: 9:00 AM - 3:30 PM","seats":0,"start":1563379200,"end":1563748200,"start_date_group":"2019-07-17","shortlink":"https:\/\/sched.co\/RwhA"},{"id":"d070e02bf71005ab620de0709ff104dc","event_type_sort":1,"event_type":["1: Programs"],"event_subtype":["Education","Library Programs","Seminars & Workshops"],"name":"Teaching with Comics: An Interactive Workshop for Educators","venue":"Shiley Special Events Suite, San Diego Central Library","description":"<strong>Peter Carlson<\/strong> (Green Dot Public Schools) and <strong>Susan Kirtley<\/strong> (Portland State University) lead this hands-on workshop designed for educators looking to integrate comics into classrooms.
